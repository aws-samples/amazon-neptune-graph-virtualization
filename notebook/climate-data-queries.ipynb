    "In a Neptune database we maintain weather station data. We represent this data as Resource Description Framework (RDF)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a data lake we keep a record of readings from those stations collected over several years. The lake data resides in Parquet files in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket. We can query that data using SQL via the Amazon Athena service. We use the AWS Glue Data Catalog to define a relational/tabular structure of the readings data. This enables Athena to see the readings data as if it came from a table. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a SPARQL query to the Neptune database, we can access the readings data from the data lake using SPARQL federated query. In SPARQL federation, we use the SERVICE directive to collect results from a second SPARQL endpoint. In our example, we wish to collect readings from the lake. But the lake can be queried using SQL, not SPARQL! We use Ontop VKG (https://ontop-vkg.org/), a tool that functions as a SPARQL endpoint but can in turn invoke a relational database using SQL. \n",
